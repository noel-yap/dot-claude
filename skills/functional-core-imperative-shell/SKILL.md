# Functional Core, Imperative Shell

A refactoring skill for separating pure business decisions (the **functional
core**) from side-effecting orchestration (the **imperative shell**). The core
is referentially transparent — given the same inputs, it always returns the
same outputs and performs no I/O. The shell reads inputs, calls the core, and
applies the resulting effects.

## When to use

Apply this refactor when any of these smells appear:

- A function performs a database/network/file call **and** branches on
  business rules in the same body.
- Tests for a function require mocking a database, clock, RNG, or HTTP client
  just to exercise pure logic.
- Adding a new business rule requires touching code that also handles I/O.
- The same business rule is duplicated across handlers because each one
  re-implements it next to its own I/O.
- A function reads `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, `process.env`, or a
  module-level singleton mid-computation.

## When NOT to use

- Trivial CRUD passthroughs with no real decisions (`getUser(id)` that just
  returns a row). Splitting these adds noise without test value.
- Code where the I/O sequence itself **is** the logic (e.g., a transactional
  saga). Express the saga's decisions as data, but don't pretend it's pure.
- One-shot scripts that will not be tested or reused.

## Core idea

Think of every function as: `(inputs, world) -> (outputs, effects)`.

- **Pure core**: a function from data to data (and optionally to a description
  of effects). No `await`, no `db.`, no `fetch`, no `Date.now()`, no logging.
- **Imperative shell**: reads from the world, calls the core, applies the
  resulting effects. Contains no branching on business rules. (See
  "Legitimate branching in the shell" below for what the shell *may*
  branch on.)

The shell becomes boring (and small). The core becomes trivially testable
(and grows as new rules arrive).

## Refactoring procedure

1. **Find the I/O boundary.** Mark every line that touches the outside world
   (DB, network, filesystem, clock, RNG, env, mutable globals).
2. **Hoist reads to the top.** Move all reads to the start of the function so
   the body operates on plain data.
3. **Defer writes.** Replace each write with a value the function will
   *return* describing what should happen. Either return a discriminated
   union of `Effect` values, or return new state plus a list of effects.
4. **Extract the pure decision.** Pull the now-pure middle into a separate
   function with an explicit signature. This is the core.
5. **Rewrite the original as a shell.** It reads, calls the core, and applies
   the returned effects.
6. **Move tests.** Delete mock-heavy tests of the old function. Write
   input/output tests against the core. Keep one or two integration tests for
   the shell to ensure the wiring works.
7. **Inject anything still impure.** If the shell is awkward to test, accept
   collaborators (db, clock, mailer) as parameters rather than importing them
   directly.

## TypeScript example 1: order processing

```typescript
// BEFORE: decisions and I/O entangled — needs db + emailService mocks to test
async function processOrder(orderId: string) {
  const order = await db.getOrder(orderId);
  if (order.total > 1000 && order.country !== "US") {
    await emailService.send(order.email, "Large international order alert");
  } else if (order.total > 1000) {
    await emailService.send(order.email, "Large order alert");
  }
  await db.updateStatus(orderId, "processed");
}
```

The decision ("which alert, if any?") is mixed with two I/O calls. Every
test needs a fake `db` and a fake `emailService` even though the logic is
pure arithmetic and string selection.

```typescript
// AFTER

// pure core: data in, data out, no I/O
type Alert =
  | { kind: "none" }
  | { kind: "large"; email: string }
  | { kind: "large-international"; email: string };

function decideAlert(order: { total: number; country: string; email: string }): Alert {
  if (order.total <= 1000) return { kind: "none" };
  if (order.country !== "US") return { kind: "large-international", email: order.email };
  return { kind: "large", email: order.email };
}
// end pure core

// imperative shell: reads, calls core, applies effects
async function processOrder(orderId: string) {
  const order = await db.getOrder(orderId);
  const alert = decideAlert(order);
  if (alert.kind === "large") {
    await emailService.send(alert.email, "Large order alert");
  } else if (alert.kind === "large-international") {
    await emailService.send(alert.email, "Large international order alert");
  }
  await db.updateStatus(orderId, "processed");
}
```

Tests for `decideAlert` are pure functions of plain objects. The shell gets
one happy-path integration test that exercises the wiring.

## TypeScript example 2: rate limiter with time and randomness

```typescript
// BEFORE: time + randomness baked in; tests must monkey-patch globals
class RateLimiter {
  private hits = new Map<string, number[]>();

  allow(userId: string): boolean {
    const now = Date.now();
    const window = this.hits.get(userId)?.filter((t) => now - t < 60_000) ?? [];
    if (window.length >= 10) {
      console.warn(`rate limit hit for ${userId}`);
      return false;
    }
    // jitter so concurrent clients don't synchronize
    if (Math.random() < 0.01) console.info(`sampling ${userId}`);
    window.push(now);
    this.hits.set(userId, window);
    return true;
  }
}
```

```typescript
// AFTER

type LimiterState = ReadonlyMap<string, readonly number[]>;
type LimiterDecision =
  | { kind: "allow"; nextState: LimiterState }
  | { kind: "deny" };

// pure core: state + inputs -> decision + next state
function decideLimit(
  state: LimiterState,
  userId: string,
  now: number,
  windowMs: number,
  maxHits: number,
): LimiterDecision {
  const recent = (state.get(userId) ?? []).filter((t) => now - t < windowMs);
  if (recent.length >= maxHits) return { kind: "deny" };
  const next = new Map(state);
  next.set(userId, [...recent, now]);
  return { kind: "allow", nextState: next };
}
// end pure core

// imperative shell: owns the mutable map, the clock, and the logger
class RateLimiter {
  private state: LimiterState = new Map();
  constructor(
    private readonly clock: () => number = Date.now,
    private readonly log: (msg: string) => void = console.warn,
  ) {}

  allow(userId: string): boolean {
    const result = decideLimit(this.state, userId, this.clock(), 60_000, 10);
    if (result.kind === "deny") {
      this.log(`rate limit hit for ${userId}`);
      return false;
    }
    this.state = result.nextState;
    return true;
  }
}
```

Note that randomness — sampling logs — was dropped. It was decoration, not
business logic. If sampling matters, the shell can do it after the core
decides; the core stays pure.

## Legitimate branching in the shell

"No branching on business rules" does not mean the shell is straight-line
code. The shell legitimately branches on three things, none of which are
domain decisions:

1. **Effect-kind dispatch** — the core returned a discriminated union of
   effects; the shell knows how to physically perform each kind.
2. **Error-class dispatch** — "is this retryable?" is a transport concern,
   not a domain decision (`AuthError` vs `RateLimitError` vs
   `TransientNetworkError`).
3. **Transport hints** — backoff math, `Retry-After` headers, connection
   state. Mechanical, driven by what the network told us.

```typescript
// pure core: decides WHAT to send (business rules live here)
type Notification =
  | { kind: "none" }
  | { kind: "email"; to: string; subject: string; body: string }
  | { kind: "sms"; to: string; body: string };

function decideNotification(
  user: { prefersChannel: "email" | "sms" | "off"; email?: string; phone?: string },
  event: { kind: "order-shipped" | "password-reset"; orderId?: string },
): Notification {
  if (user.prefersChannel === "off") return { kind: "none" };
  const body = event.kind === "order-shipped"
    ? `Your order ${event.orderId} has shipped.`
    : "A password reset was requested.";
  if (user.prefersChannel === "email" && user.email)
    return { kind: "email", to: user.email, subject: "Update", body };
  if (user.prefersChannel === "sms" && user.phone)
    return { kind: "sms", to: user.phone, body };
  return { kind: "none" };
}
// end pure core

type Deps = {
  loadUser: (id: string) => Promise<{ prefersChannel: "email" | "sms" | "off"; email?: string; phone?: string }>;
  email: { send: (to: string, subject: string, body: string) => Promise<void> };
  sms: { send: (to: string, body: string) => Promise<void> };
  sleep: (ms: number) => Promise<void>;
};

// imperative shell: three legitimate branches, zero business rules
async function notify(
  userId: string,
  event: { kind: "order-shipped" | "password-reset"; orderId?: string },
  deps: Deps,
) {
  const user = await deps.loadUser(userId);
  const n = decideNotification(user, event);

  // (1) Effect-kind dispatch — the core already chose; the shell just performs.
  switch (n.kind) {
    case "none":  return;
    case "email": return sendWithRetry(() => deps.email.send(n.to, n.subject, n.body), deps.sleep);
    case "sms":   return sendWithRetry(() => deps.sms.send(n.to, n.body), deps.sleep);
  }
}

async function sendWithRetry(send: () => Promise<void>, sleep: (ms: number) => Promise<void>) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < 3; attempt++) {
    try { await send(); return; }
    catch (err) {
      // (2) Error-class dispatch — "should this be retried?" is a transport concern.
      if (err instanceof AuthError) throw err;
      if (err instanceof RateLimitError) {
        // (3) Transport hint — backoff driven by what the network told us.
        await sleep(err.retryAfterMs ?? 1000);
        continue;
      }
      if (err instanceof TransientNetworkError) {
        await sleep(2 ** attempt * 100);
        continue;
      }
      throw err;
    }
  }
  throw new Error("send failed after 3 attempts");
}
```

A business-rule branch — the kind that *belongs in the core* — would look
like `if (user.prefersChannel === "email")` or
`if (event.kind === "password-reset")`. Both appear only inside
`decideNotification`.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Pseudo-pure core.** A "pure" function that takes a `db` parameter and
  awaits it is still a shell. The core must not depend on collaborators that
  perform I/O.
- **Effects as callbacks passed in.** Passing `onAlert: () => Promise<void>`
  into the core moves the boundary back inside. Return effect descriptions
  instead; let the shell perform them.
- **Hidden time and randomness.** Reading `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`
  inside what you call the core defeats the point. Pass them in as values.
- **Splitting one function into two co-located halves.** If the "core" is
  only ever called by one shell and tested through it, you have not gained
  testability — you have only added a function. Split when the core has
  meaningful behavior worth testing in isolation.
- **Over-decomposition.** Not every line of a handler needs to become a pure
  helper. Aim for a core that captures the *decisions*, not every expression.

## Validation checklist

After refactoring, verify:

- [ ] The pure core has no `await`, `db.`, `fetch(`, `Date.now()`,
      `Math.random()`, `process.env`, `console.`, or imports of I/O modules.
- [ ] Tests for the core run in milliseconds and use no test doubles.
- [ ] The shell is short enough to read in one screen and contains only
      orchestration, not branching on business rules. Any branches in the
      shell fall into effect-kind dispatch, error-class dispatch, or
      transport hints.
- [ ] Removing the shell does not change the core's tests.
- [ ] At least one integration test exercises the shell end-to-end.

## Running the skill's own tests

This skill ships with pytest tests that validate its structure (frontmatter,
required sections, BEFORE/AFTER pairing, and that "pure core" code blocks
contain no I/O tokens):
