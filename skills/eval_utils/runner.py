"""Invoking `claude -p` and parsing the result into `EvalRun`s.

The I/O layer of the harness: it is the only module that spawns
subprocesses and scrubs the environment. `run_claude` is a single live
call; `run_claude_batch` overlaps `count` independent calls for one eval to
measure the model's run-to-run variance. Evals are non-deterministic, so
nothing here caches — every trial is a fresh invocation.
