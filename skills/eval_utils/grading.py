"""Deciding eval verdicts from repeated trials, the Bayesian way.

Each graded check is a Bernoulli process: on any single `claude -p` run the
skill-with-prompt either satisfies the assertion (with unknown true pass
rate ``theta``) or not. We never observe ``theta`` -- only ``k`` passes out
of ``n`` trials. So instead of thresholding a raw count we put a posterior
on ``theta`` and ask how much of it clears a target rate.

  * Model: ``k ~ Binomial(n, theta)``, prior ``theta ~ Beta(1, 1)`` (uniform).
    Beta is conjugate to the binomial, so the posterior is closed-form:
    ``theta | (k, n) ~ Beta(1 + k, 1 + (n - k))`` -- each batch of trials
    just bumps the two parameters, no sampling.
  * Bar: ``TARGET_RATE`` (default 2/3) is the true pass rate a good skill
    should clear. ``posterior_pass_prob`` returns
    ``p_good = P(theta >= TARGET_RATE | k, n)`` via the regularized
    incomplete beta function (the Beta CDF), stdlib-only.
  * Verdict band: PASS once ``p_good > PASS_THRESHOLD`` (1 - e^-2 ~ 0.865),
    FAIL once ``p_good < FAIL_THRESHOLD`` (e^-2 ~ 0.135); in between the
    evidence is inconclusive and more trials are worth running. The band is
    symmetric so an early unlucky streak does not lock a verdict.

Two concerns live here. First, the adaptive driver: `_eval_checks` derives
the pass/fail checks for an eval, `next_batch_size` decides how many more
trials are worth running given the posterior so far, and `run_eval_adaptive`
loops the two until the verdict is fixed -- capping cost at `MAX_TRIALS`
runs while spending as few as `BATCH_FLOOR` when a clean streak settles it.
Second, the grading rollups (`trial_outcomes`, `eval_passed`,
`assert_eval_passed`, `failing_assertions`, `trigger_pass_counts`) that
per-skill tests use to grade and report on a completed batch of runs.
